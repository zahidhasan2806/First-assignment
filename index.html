                <h2>Corned Beef</h2>
                <p>Corned beef is salt-cured brisket of beef.The term comes from the treatment of the meat with
                    large-grained rock salt, also called "corns" of salt. Sometimes, sugar and spices are also added to
                    corned beef recipes. Corned beef is featured as an ingredient in many cuisines.</p>

                <h2>Butternut Squash Soup</h2>
                <p>I kept the ingredients list simple so the squash flavor can shine through, but the end result offers
                    exceptionally rich flavor. You’ll only need eight basic ingredients to make this luscious soup:
                    butternut squash, olive oil, butter, shallot, garlic, vegetable broth, maple syrup and nutmeg.</p>

                <h2>Easy Meatloaf</h2>
                <p>The secret to making a meatloaf taste really good is to use fatty beef, plenty of flavourings and to
                    grate your onion instead of dicing it. ingredient to make this i used Ground Beef,bread
                    crumbs,egg,beaten onion powder,garlic powder,black pepper salt ,ketchup</p>
